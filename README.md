### Here's my argument: Already the Opening Government has failed to properly define breakup they don't know what are the bad things that happen, their arguments are irrelevant essentialy. They fail  to recognize that these Chaebol's affect almost everything in economy, popularity, and the relevance of the company. If the Chaebol were to be broken it would result into a competition nwhere they can still and will be able to manipulate the economy of South Korea. The South Korea has a stable economy because of these company, South Korea are well-known because of these product and since we're arguing about in an economic standpoint if we were to remove these companies the risk of an economic backlash would be prominent. Example: Let's look at how, LG, Samsung, and Hyundai are so successful and made impact to the country and to the world. The world will find their most advanced technology gone and considering the family running these companies are already well-built and well constructed because of the generations running these. Let's look at the people, they'll easily lose the things they love that the company offer LG, we'll lose their advance technologies we know how advance South Korea are, Samsung, we'll lose their unique phones. In general it's not good because all countries should be able to contribute to make mentions. Let's also look at the workers, Job, stability, supply the family, a lot of workers will lose their job the reason why I can say a lot, it's because their companies are well-known like I said. Let's not look at the Government, The supplies of the government with tax money and let's not forget what these companies made, again the impact, if the government decide to break it up, their countries wouldn't be advanced and I'm not saying that LG, Samsung are the only thing that is technologically advanced but IO'm just saying their very important, there are many brands everywhere. That is it for my speech thanks for listening!
