> Topic: This house believes that South Korean government should break up the chaebol's Here's my argument: Let us first define the meaning of chaebol, Chaebol is an English transliteration of the Korean word 재벌, which means plutocracy, rich business family, or monopoly. The chaebol structure can encompass a single large company or several groups of companies, now that we have a proper idea of what a chaebol is, here's my argument, Already the Opening Government has failed to properly define breakup they don't know what are the bad things that happen, their arguments are irrelevant essentialy. They fail  to recognize that these Chaebol's affect almost everything in economy, popularity, and the relevance of the company. If the Chaebol were to be broken it would result into a competition where they can still and will be able to manipulate the economy of South Korea. The South Korea has a stable economy because of these company, South Korea are well-known because of these product and since we're arguing about in an economic standpoint if we were to remove these companies the risk of an economic backlash would be prominent. Example: Let's look at how, LG, Samsung, and Hyundai are so successful and made impact to the country and to the world. The world will find their most advanced technology gone and considering the family running these companies are already well-built and well constructed because of the generations running these. Let's look at the people, they'll easily lose the things they love that the company offer LG, we'll lose their advance technologies we know how advance South Korea are, Samsung, we'll lose their unique phones. In general it's not good because all countries should be able to contribute to make mentions. Let's also look at the workers, Job, stability, supply the family, a lot of workers will lose their job the reason why I can say a lot, it's because their companies are well-known like I said. Let's not look at the Government, The supplies of the government with tax money and let's not forget what these companies made, again the impact, if the government decide to break it up, their countries wouldn't be advanced and I'm not saying that LG, Samsung are the only thing that is technologically advanced but I
'm just saying their very important, there are many brands everywhere. That is it for my speech thanks for listening!  Here's my argument why Github is the best website to use, let's first define github, github is a well-known website builder it's been used by millions of people where, they mainly talk about free thing. Now here's why it's important we want to experience the best free services and that's what Github offers, Github allows us to send links from free games and that's what some people want and want as an experience, the github website offeres a simple coding, with a simple cheat sheet you are able to know the proper parts and functions of a github website it's very simple, we just need to properly use the symbols such as the dashes, brackets and parenthesis. it's a key important part to making a website, because in life nothing is free but GitHun passes and defeats that quote of its amazing purposes, now let's look at some rebuttals, does google sites perform better than Github? first of all, no Github is better since they have a better and simpler way to: 1. Italicized, fonts, 2. Darkmode it's safer and relaxing for the eyes, 3. No complicated things such as a carousel wheel? like what even is a carousel wheel feature it' does not properly aim for what the user wants. Another rebuttal is canva is better, well no again, it's the toughest way to make a website why? once you use a website there's a chance that you will be getting a copyright strike and that's not what we users, or editors, or website coding makers want, we simply want simplicity because that's what we believe that is true, Canva distracts us from using templates and it's very complicated to transfer pages while if you want to see the github pages it's not complicated it only has two parts, edit and preview which proves why it's mainly the best website maker of all. in an overview and why i won this debate is that i tell you why its important to get less stress and simplicity
